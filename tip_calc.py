# 1. Tip Calculator
# Your task is to write a program that calculates how much of a tip to leave at a restaurant.

# Prompt the user for two things:

# The total bill amount
# The level of service, which can be one of the following: good, fair, or bad
# Calculate the tip amount and the total amount (bill amount + tip amount). The tip percentage based
#  on the level of service is based on:

# good -> 20%
# fair -> 15%
# bad -> 10%

#setup

bill = int(input('Enter total of bill: '))
service_level = input('How was the service? /(Good, Fair, Bad/)').lower

#code to make it happen


#final output
print tip
ptint bill_total
